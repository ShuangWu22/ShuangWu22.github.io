#### About

My name is Shuang Wu. I am currently a PhD in Statistics at [University of Caligornia, Los Angeles](http://statistics.ucla.edu/) after spending two years on graduate studies at [Purdue University](https://www.stat.purdue.edu/). I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof.Guang Cheng](https://www.stat.purdue.edu/~chengg/index.html) and extremely happy to work with [Prof.Pan Li](https://sites.google.com/view/panli-purdue). My other collaborators include Yuantong Li, Chi-hua Wang and Mingxuan Zhang etc. Before becoming a doctoral student, I received a BS in statistics from [Sun Yat-sen University](http://math.sysu.edu.cn/) in 2017 and a MS in Biostatistics from [Columbia University](http://www.mailman.columbia.edu/academic-departments/biostatistics) in 2019. 


#### Research Interests

My general research interest is theory and practice of machine learning and my current research focuses on Trustworthy Artificial intelligence, Graph Machine Learning and Bandit Algorithms. See [research page](research.html) for more information.

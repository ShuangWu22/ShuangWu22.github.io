#### About

I am currently a PhD in Statistics at [Purdue University](https://www.stat.purdue.edu/), advised by [Guang Cheng](https://www.stat.purdue.edu/~chengg/index.html) and [Pan Li](https://sites.google.com/view/panli-purdue/home). My research focuses on theoretical and practical machine learning and current research direction can be summarized as data augmentation and data privacy in graph learning model.

Before becoming a doctoral student, I received a BS in statistics from [Sun Yat-sen University](http://math.sysu.edu.cn/) in 2017 and a MS in Biostatistics from [Columbia University](http://www.mailman.columbia.edu/academic-departments/biostatistics) in 2019.
